compare_algos_plot.py

Usage:
  python compare_algos_plot.py results_backtracking.txt results_dp.txt ...

Description:
  Reads multiple results files, each containing lines of the form:
    n time cost parenthesization
  where 'n' is the number of matrices, 'time' is the solve time for that instance,
  'cost' is the best cost, and 'parenthesization' is a string representation of the
  solution.

  For each file:
    - Parse all (n, time) pairs
    - Group times by n
    - Compute the average solve time for each n
    - Plot them on a shared graph for comparison.
  The legend entry for each curve is derived from the filename (minus its extension).

Example:
  python compare_algos_plot.py results_backtracking.txt results_dp.txt
